This repository contains all of Cassie Thill's projects from:
 2012 BDW (bdw.colorado.edu) Semester 1 — Intro to Programming
 ---taught by the amazing Jay Zeschin & Collin Schaafsma
 

 All projects were completed in Ruby 1.9.3. There are five projects (and 8 files) in total. In sequential order:

 1. cass_goals.rb outlines my goals for the class & the semester. 

 2. The kickstarter folder contains three files, each completing one piece of the following assignment: A) Write a program that calculates the average amount of revenue kickstarter makes a day based on all project stats. B) Write a program using variables that will tell us how many square feet of stain it would take to cover all the tables in this lab twice in a human readable format (a string). C) Write a program using variables that will tell us how many months, days, hours, minutes and seconds are left in the year 2012 for humans and dogs in a human readable format.

 3. methods_music.rb is a program that uses methods, booleans, strings, fixnums, and floats to represent the actions of an object in the real world—in this case: Music. It calculates the amount of music a person listens to based on getting ready time, travel time, class time, etc. Later on, it was reformatted to include arrays & hashes.

 4. sodamachine.rb is a program that simulates a soda machine. It uses simple conditionals to keep track of the amount of each type of soda in the machine based on user input (ie. loading the machine or purchasing a beverage). 

 5. blackjackforrealz.rb is a simulation of a Blackjack game. The lectures informing this piece focused on OO, Classes & Instances.
